\section{Overview}

The foundation for this project was laid during the requirements gathering and formulation phase. In order to deliver a good system and streamline the planning process, one first has to develop a strong understanding of the tasks a B\&B system has to fulfil as well as the challenges that it should overcome. Further, as exemplified by Boehm \cite{Boehm1988} and Brooks \cite{Brooks1975}, incorrect and incomplete requirements can lead to an exponential increase in cost during later stages of project development. For these reasons, a considerable amount of the early project phase was spent on gathering requirements, as can be seen in figure \ref{gantt-chart}.

The requirements were gathered in an iterative process, starting with collective brainstorming during the team's weekly group meetings. Most of the team members had used online accommodation booking solutions before and could thus derive initial requirements from their own prior experiences. Next, the team studied current online accommodation booking services and took note of the functionality they offered. This research resulted in an exhaustive initial requirements list. Most of the essential requirements were so-called CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that each concerned a different entity in the System. These categories were therefore used to structure the requirements list seen below. Through subsequent iteration, especially during the use case definition phase, the initially long requirements list was condensed into a concise set of project requirements. Importance was assigned to the requirements according to the MoSCoW scale, ranking them based on their importance: whether they \textbf{M}ust, \textbf{S}hould, \textbf{C}ould or \textbf{W}on't be included.

The MoSCoW ranking facilitated clear communication within the project group and provided a good starting point for the later stages of this project since they indicate the approximate concern with which each issue should be approached.

The requirements lists are split up into multiple tables, sorted first by functional and non-functional requirements and then subdivided by the main entities they are concerned with.

\section{Functional Requirements}

The functional requirements listed below define the application architecture of the B\&B system. They are concerned with the services that the system provides and the results that it delivers.

Out of these functional requirements, all but two were included in the first version outlined in this report. The first of these two requirements is R-R-D-1: The System shall allow the deletion of Ratings for a given Property. It was not included as in the system's current iteration a User can override their prior rating to a property by rating it again. Use Case R-C (Table \ref{use_case_r-c}) therefore implicitly contains the functionality of R-R-D-1. The second excluded requirement is R-P-O-1: The System shall allow a User to share Property Details with their contacts. While a desirable feature to have on the platform in future iterations, this feature was deemed not essential enough to be included in this first version of the B\&B system.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

The non-functional requirements listed below concern the technical architecture of the B\&B system. They are concerned with \textit{how} the system performs rather than \textit{what} it delivers.

    \rowcolors{2}{gray!10}{white}
    \begin{tabular}{| p{1.8cm} | p{9cm} | P{1.5cm} | P{2.7cm} | }
        \hline
        \rowcolor{gray!30} ID      & Description & Priority & Category \\ \hline
        R-N-C-1  & The System shall be written in a commonly used programming language. & Should & Code \\ \hline
        R-N-C-2  & The System shall use a relational database system. & Should & Code \\ \hline
        R-N-R-1  & The System shall be able to backup information. & Could & Reliability \\ \hline
        R-N-R-2  & The System shall not lose any data. & Must & Reliability \\ \hline
        R-N-R-3  & The System shall have a high uptime. & Must & Reliability \\ \hline
        R-N-Su-1 & The System shall be well documented. & Should & Supportability \\ \hline
        R-N-Su-2 & The System shall provide helpful error messages. & Should & Supportability \\ \hline
        R-N-Se-1 & The System shall store customer information securely. & Must & Security \\ \hline
        R-N-Se-2 & The System shall store account details securely. & Must & Security \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\section{Domain Model}

Based on these requirements, a domain model was created. It describes the relationships between the different entities in the system. This model was instrumental in eliminating possible ambiguity about the different relationships concerning the logical ownership of certain entities. Throughout the subsequent use case definition phase the domain model was used to clarify these relationships while naturally evolving as new relationships became salient and others were deemed out of focus.
